## Overview

A `<subcircuit />` is a powerful organizational element in tscircuit that
represents a collection of elements that are tightly coupled. Subcircuits are
often used for a small functional block, such as a voltage regulator.

Within a subcircuit, you can have a custom autorouter or isolated nets from the
larger circuits. You can also re-use reference designators. Your subcircuit is
essentially isolated from other subcircuits.

import CircuitPreview from "@site/src/components/CircuitPreview"

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit1" schX={-2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit2" schX={2}>
        <resistor name="R2" resistance="1k"  />
      </subcircuit>
      <trace from=".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1" to=".subcircuit2 .R2 .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>

## Re-using Reference Designators

Re-using reference designators is typically considered a bad practice, but in
tscircuit reference designators are intelligently prefixed prior to being
written on the silkscreen. This means that you can design your subcircuits
without worrying about whether or not a reference designator has been previously
used.

<CircuitPreview
  defaultView="schematic"
  code={`
  export default () => (
    <board width="10mm" height="10mm">
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit1" schX={-2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <subcircuit name="subcircuit2" schX={2}>
        <resistor name="R1" resistance="1k" />
      </subcircuit>
      <trace from=".subcircuit1 .R1 .pin1" to=".subcircuit2 .R1 .pin1" />
    </board>
  )
  `}
/>
